    "To illustrate the gain and lift charts, we will be using the bank marketing dataset. The data describes a problem in which a bank is interested in predicting which customers may respond to their direct marketing campaign to open a term deposit with the bank. The response variable Y = 1 implies that the customer opens a term deposit after the campaign and Y = 0 otherwise. The marketing campaign is based on the phone calls."
